## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS



## Challenges/Future Goals/ Bugs
* Placing your horizontal ships, if any div is placed after "square" 99 the front divs land on the board with the rest of the ship lost off the board.
* To place a vertical ship accuratly you must grab the ship by the first DIV that makes up the ship. Else it will jump or not lay omn the board.
* Ships can be placed on top of each other.


## Special Thanks
* Thank you to the General Assembly SEIR-ERICA instructional team and classmates for support and mentorship.
