# Battleship
A take on the classic table top gameboard. This is my first project with General Assembly and my first true project as a programmer.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS



## Challenges/Future Goals/ Bugs
* Placing your horizontal ships, if any div is placed after "square" 99 the front divs land on the board with the rest of the ship lost off the board.
* To place a vertical ship accuratly you must grab the ship by the first DIV that makes up the ship. Else it will jump or not lay omn the board.
* Ships can be placed on top of each other.
* Would like gameGo() to have logic where if a computer turn results in a hit the next turn would be randomly selected from the surrounding eight squares only. 
* Would love to add remote multi-player game play.
